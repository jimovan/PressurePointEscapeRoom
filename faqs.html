                        solve a variety of mind-boggling clues and puzzles. Each team has 60 minutes to work their way
                        through the room and 'escape'.</p>

                        accommodate larger groups (max. 14 people) at the location but this needs to be arranged before
                        hand and the group will be split to take turns.
